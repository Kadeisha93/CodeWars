/*Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.

Example : n=5 >> [5,4,3,2,1]*/


const reverseSeq = n => {
let arr = []; 
  for (let i=n; i>0; i--) {
    arr.push(i);
    } return arr;
};

// let arr= [] creates an array
// create a for loop with i = n, i(which is n) continues as long as it's greater than 0, with i-- because numbers are going in descending order
// .push method adds elements to the end of the array
