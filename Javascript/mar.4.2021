/*Create a function that takes 2 positive integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):
  sumStr("4", "5")    // should output "9"
  sumStr("34", "5")   // should output "39"
If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.*/


function sumStr(a,b) {
  return (+a+ +b)+''  
}

//Used unary + to convert the string into an integer. Then added '' at the end so we could return the number as a string, as the question wanted
